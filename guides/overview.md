# Overview

Ergo is a parser combinator library written in Elixir. The name 'Ergo' comes from 'ergo' which mean' 'therefore' which means 'for that reason' which seemed appropriate for a parser.

If you are already familiar with parser combinators, great! If not we have a [gentle introduction](parser_combinator_intro.html) or see SaÅ¡a JuriÄ‡'s talk where he [builds up parser combinators from the ground up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNzoerDljjo).

If you want to know why you should (or shouldn't) use Ergo see [comparison with other parser combinator libraries](comparisons.md).

## How to install Ergo.

Add Ergo to your mix.exs file:

    {:ergo, "~> 0.4"}

Then run

    mix deps.get
